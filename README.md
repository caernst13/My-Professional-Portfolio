# My-Professional-Portfolio

This project is the creation of a basic portfolio that I will add to as I creat more projects that showcase my skill as a coder. I used html and CSS in this project in order to creat the bases for the webise and then give it some decortation and look nice. 

I learned a lot while making this. I got more comforitable with using flex to move elements around the  webpage to where I want them to be. I also learned a lot about how to make grids in order again for elements to apear where I want them to. I got much more comforatable with implementing links and picture. I also began to scratch the serface of changing the layout based on screen size but know I have a lot to learn going forward with this.
